# AutoMaxLair
**NOTE: the functionality of AutoMaxLair has now been implemented in the user-friendly [ComputerControl program suite](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl).**
We advise using the Python version only if:
* You want to modify the code yourself, or
* You want to hunt bosses with certain IV distributions.

All discussion related to both dynamax adventure bots can be found in the [Pokemon Automation Discord](https://discord.gg/PokemonAutomation).

AutoMaxLair is a bot for shiny hunting legendary Pokemon in Dynamax Adventures found in Pokemon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra. The program runs on a computer connected to the Switch through a microcontroller (outgoing controls to the Switch) and an HDMI capture card (incoming video from the Switch).

We have migrated our setup and operation instructions to a wiki. [Please refer there for detailed setup and troubleshooting instructions](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/AutoMaxLair/wiki). 

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [PokéSprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite) for hosting the sprites of the Pokémon and balls and [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for hosting data on Pokémon, abilities, and moves. We also thank [LUFA](http://www.lufa-lib.org/) for their AVR framework with which the microcontroller code would not work without. Finally, we thank [brianuuu](https://github.com/brianuuu) for the [AutoController](https://github.com/brianuuu/AutoController_swsh) program family on which our legacy microcontroller code is based.

## Contributors
AutoMaxLair was initially written by [ercdndrs](https://github.com/ercdndrs). It has been supported by code contributions from [pifopi](https://github.com/pifopi) and [denvoros](https://github.com/denvoros), as well as advice and testing by multiple users in the [Pokemon Automation Discord](https://discord.gg/PokemonAutomation). We thank the server mod team, most notably [Mystical](https://github.com/Mysticial), for cultivating this space for us to meet, discuss, and collaborate. We also thank all the contributors shown by GitHub, and Discord users Miguel90 and fawress.

## Supporting us
We do not take donations of any kind for this project. The only support we request is by sharing our work with your friends if you have enjoyed using it. Further, in the spirit of transparency, we would prefer that you disclose the use of our tool (or at least an indication of automation) when sharing photos of Pokemon caught using it. If such a disclosure is not permissible, we ask that you avoid any explicit or implicit claims that such Pokemon were caught manually.
