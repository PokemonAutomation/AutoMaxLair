# ========== Configuration file for AutoMaxLair ==========
# What follows is the set of configurations for the AutoMaxLair program.
# Please be sure to read carefully the descriptions of the settings and
# adjust them as necessary for your circumstances.
#
# PLEASE NOTE that you will need to review the settings after each run.
#
# TOML also has specific formatting (useful so that the program runs properly!)
# so please be sure to not add or remove decimal points or quotes
# and do not modify the style in this file. Also, `true` and `false`
# should ALWAYS be lower case!
# ========================================================

# === BOSS ===
# This is the boss that you are resetting for. This is a string for the name.
#   NOTE: this allows the program to properly select Pokémon and Moves throughout the run.
#   IMPORTANT: Use entirely lower case letters and replace all spaces with hyphens.
#       e.g. "moltres" "kyurem" "tapu-koko" "tapu-lele"
#   The boss name also needs to be its English name due to internal storage.
#   Bosses with multiple formes need to have the forme specified.
#   This includes the following:
#       "giratina-altered", "thundurus-incarnate", "tornadus-incarnate", "landorus-incarnate", "zygarde-50"
BOSS = "dialga"
# === BASE_BALL ===
# This is the Pokéball that should be used for all Pokémon except for the boss.
#   This is the id of the ball to use (in english)
BASE_BALL = "premier-ball"
# === BASE_BALLS ===
# This is the current quantity of the ball that you selected in BASE_BALL
BASE_BALLS = 600
# === LEGENDARY_BALL ===
# This is the Pokéball that should be used for just the legendary boss Pokémon.
#   This is the id of the ball to use (in english)
LEGENDARY_BALL = "premier-ball"
# === LEGENDARY_BALLS ===
# This is the current quantity of the ball that you selected in LEGENDARY_BALL.
#   The program will end if this ever hits zero.
LEGENDARY_BALLS = 500
# === MODE ===
# This is the mode that the program should use.
# These are the options:
#   "DEFAULT" - The default mode of the script.
#       This will never reset the game. This is perfect if you have many legendary Pokéballs
#       and would like to accumulate Dynite Ore.
#   "BALL SAVER" - Resets the game if the legendary is caught and it isn't shiny.
#       It will also keep track of your Dynite Ore so that if you cannot pay the fee
#       for multiple resets, it will skip catching the legendary. Use this if you have
#       a small number of Pokéballs to use with the legendary.
#   "STRONG BOSS" - Similar to "BALL SAVER" but also checks other Pokémon for shinies.
#       This mode is useful for locking on a seed that is capable of beating the boss, but will
#       still take non-legendary shinies.
#   "KEEP PATH" - Will force the game to always reset on a pre-saved path.
#       Similar to "BALL SAVER" and "STRONG BOSS" but will always use the same path if it fails.
#       This will deplete your Ore quickly.
#   "FIND PATH" - Will run like default mode but will stop as soon as it win once. It can be used
#       alongside KEEP PATH to find a winning path. It's up  to the user to check if the path was
#       good or not.
MODE = "STRONG BOSS"

# === COM_PORT ===
# The COM Port is how your system internally connects to your Serial connection.
#   On Windows it will be of the form `COMX` where X is some number. 
#       View your available devices for the exact string.
#   On Mac and Linux, it will be a path that begins with `/dev/`. See the documenation for more information.
COM_PORT = "COM4"
# === VIDEO_INDEX ===
# The video index is which index OpenCV uses in your input devices to read from your capture card.
#   For most users this number will be either 0 or 1 depending on the number of cameras you have plugged in.
VIDEO_INDEX = 1
# === TESSERACT_PATH ===
# This is the path to the Tesseract executable. This is NOT where the pytesseract
# package is installed but where tesseract is installed.
# On Windows this is likely inside Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR.
# On Mac and Linux, it will likely be in a place like /usr/bin (run `which tesseract` in your terminal to get the path)
TESSERACT_PATH = "C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe"

# ==========
# === ADVANCED SETTINGS
[advanced]
# === VIDEO_SCALE ===
# The scaling for the live display of the script.
#   Set to less than 1 if you want the image smaller than the default size (1920x1080).
#   Please make sure there's always a decimal at the end of this value even if setting to 1 (e.g. 1.0).
VIDEO_SCALE = 0.5
# === VIDEO_EXTRA_DELAY ===
# Input a time (in seconds) if your capture card has any significant delay.
#   Most configurations can leave this value at 0 but people using 
#   OBS virtual camera may have to increase this value to 1 or 2 (seconds).
#   Please make sure there's always a decimal at the end of this value.
VIDEO_EXTRA_DELAY = 0.0
# === BOSS_INDEX ===
# The position of the boss you're hunting on the menu. 
#   0 is the top, 1 is the middle, and 2 is the bottom.
BOSS_INDEX = 0
# === DYNITE_ORE ===
# The current amount of Dynite Ore you're willing to lose by resetting.
# If this value is negative, the bot will first collect ore before spending any.
# Not necessary if using DEFAULT mode.
DYNITE_ORE = 0
# === CONSECUTIVE_RESETS ===
# If you had to stop the script and have not reset your reset counter by clearing
# an adventure, set this number to how many you previously had.
CONSECUTIVE_RESETS = 0
# === MAXIMUM_ORE_COST ===
# The maximum ore cost you're willing to pay in order to reset once.
MAXIMUM_ORE_COST = 10

# you're running into problems and need to report to the developers what's happening.
